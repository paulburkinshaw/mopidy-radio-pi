Running extension while developing
-----------------------------------
Once your extension is ready to go, to see it in action you’ll need to register it with Mopidy. 
Typically this is done by running python setup.py install from your extension’s Git repo root directory. 
While developing your extension and to avoid doing this every time you make a change, you can instead run python setup.py develop to effectively link Mopidy directly with your development files.

While being developed the solution files have been dropped into:
	- home/pi/radio-pi-development_version/mopidy-radio-pi 

in ssh navigate to the above path and run sudo python setup.py develop
